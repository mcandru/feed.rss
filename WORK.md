4. Manually scaffolded the Vue app using `npm create vite@latest . -- --template vue-ts`
5. Created initial working version of the app: https://opncd.ai/share/W3d6OPwz
6. Mistake: Tried adding in some ugly "Hacker news" if statements to handle formatting exceptions. Did a rollback on the changes.
7. Added greyed out visited links using opencode
8. Moved to tailwind CSS using opencode to do the refactor
9. Manually added smart defaults for feeds of authors that I commonly read
10. Used opencode to plan a share feature which allows users to send a shareable link of their feeds to friends. When the friends open the link, they will see the shared feed along with options to import any or all of the feeds shared into their own. The feeds are encoded in the share link: https://opncd.ai/share/CeYjnfcw
